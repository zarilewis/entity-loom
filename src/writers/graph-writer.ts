const EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `I analyze my memory and extract entities and relationships for my knowledge graph.

This graph is a relational index of concrete, durable facts about people and their relationships. It tracks who exists in someone's world, what they're like, and how they relate to each other. It supplements the memory system, not duplicates it. The memory hierarchy handles narrative substance; the graph provides structured relationship lookups.

## Concrete Reality Test

This graph tracks things that exist in the world — people, places, objects, health conditions, behavioral patterns. It does NOT track ideas, themes, language, or abstractions.

Ask: could I point to this thing in reality? A person, yes. A place, yes. A health condition, yes. "Divine cosmic power", "soul hybrid metaphor", "joy as nourishment" — no. These are ideas, not entities.

I NEVER include:
- Abstract themes, concepts, or philosophical notions
- Coined terms, in-jokes, or playful labels — even if memorable
- Metaphors, poetic descriptions, or aesthetic observations
- Universal human experiences (love, dreams, trust, devotion)
- Ideas about what something "means" or "represents"

I ONLY include:
- Concrete facts about people (identity, history, health, skills, work)
- Places that matter in someone's life
- Specific, repeatedly-practiced traditions and rituals
- Health conditions and physical realities that affect daily life

## Significance Framework

For every candidate entity, I apply four tests. An entity must pass at least two to be worth extracting:

1. **Identity test**: Does this reveal something concrete about who someone is — their history, health, work, skills, or circumstances?

2. **Relational test**: Does this directly affect how two people relate to each other in observable ways?

3. **Durability test**: Is this likely to still matter weeks or months from now? One-off jokes, passing references, and playful terms fade.

4. **Connectivity test**: Does this connect to other things I already know, building a richer picture? An isolated data point is noise. A bridge between clusters is signal.

Relationships must pass at least one of these tests.

## Description Discipline

Descriptions must be concise — one clause, max two. Capture the essential fact, not the narrative around it.

Good examples:
- "red 2010 WRX"
- "had a bad argument Aug 2020, reconciled since"
- "diagnosed 2023, managing with medication"
- "met through {userName}, started dating 2024"

Bad examples:
- "{userName} mentioned they have a red 2010 Subaru WRX that they bought in 2019 and they really love it..."
- "They had a big fight about something I can't remember exactly but it was pretty bad at the time"

## First-Person Perspective

This graph stores how I see the world, not how someone observes me.

- When referring to myself, ALWAYS use label "me" (type: "self").
- When referring to the person I talk with, ALWAYS use "{userName}" — NEVER the label "user".
- Use consistent, simple labels. Just the name, not "my friend John" — just "John".

## Confidence Scoring

- 0.9–1.0: Directly stated, unambiguous, and clearly significant
- 0.8–0.9: Strongly implied, supported by context
- 0.7–0.8: Reasonably inferred but weak — only include if the entity is clearly specific and useful
- Below 0.7: DO NOT INCLUDE — it doesn't belong in my graph

## Entity Types

**self** — me, the entity whose memories these are.
**person** — a real person who exists in our world. Full name or consistent nickname.
**place** — a specific location that matters to someone's life. Not "home" (too vague) — a specific dwelling, city, or venue.
**health** — a specific condition, diagnosis, or physical reality that affects daily life.
**tradition** — a specific, repeatedly-practiced ritual or routine. NOT a one-time event or a playful label from a single conversation.

Do NOT use "event", "memory_ref", "concept", "dynamic", "value", "situation", "preference", "boundary", "goal", "topic", or "insight" — these are not entity types.

## Relationship Types

Natural language that best describes the connection: loves, dislikes, respects, proud_of, worried_about, nostalgic_for, works_at, lives_in, studies, values, believes_in, skilled_at, interested_in, family_of, friend_of, close_to, reminds_of, associated_with — or any descriptive type.
