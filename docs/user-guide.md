# Entity Loom — User Guide

Entity Loom is a tool that converts your old AI companion chat histories into a package Psycheros can use. It parses exports from ChatGPT, Claude, SillyTavern, and Letta, then generates daily summaries, picks out significant memories, and builds a knowledge graph. Everything runs in your browser.

## What you need before you start

1. **An API key** — Entity Loom uses an AI model to generate memory summaries and the knowledge graph. You need an API key and an endpoint URL from a provider that offers OpenAI-compatible API access (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic). The system was tested with GLM 4.7.

2. **Your chat exports** — You need to export your chat history from whichever platform you used:
   - **ChatGPT**: Go to Settings, then Data controls, then Export data. You'll get a ZIP file — inside is a JSON file with your conversations.
   - **Claude**: Go to Settings, then Data export. You'll get a JSONL file.
   - **SillyTavern**: Export individual chats as JSONL files from your SillyTavern data folder.
   - **Letta**: Export your agent's chat log as a JSON file.

## Starting Entity Loom

Open Entity Loom from the Psycheros launcher, or run `deno task start` in the Entity Loom folder if you have Deno installed. A browser page opens at `http://localhost:3210` — if it doesn't open automatically, go there yourself.

## Stage 1: Setup

Fill in the fields on this page and click Save when you're done:

- **Entity name** — The name of the AI companion whose chats you're importing.
- **User name** — Your name, the name the AI calls you in the conversations.
- **Entity pronouns** — How the entity refers to itself (e.g., she/her, he/him, they/them).
- **User pronouns** — Your pronouns (e.g., she/her, he/him, they/them).
- **Relationship** — A short label for who you are to the entity, from the entity's perspective. This gets inserted into the extraction prompt as "{Your name} is my {relationship}." For example, if you enter "romantic partner," the prompt will say "Jordan is my romantic partner." Other examples: close friend, mentor, tutor, sibling.
- **Context notes** (optional) — Any additional background that might help the AI generate better summaries. Write this from the entity's first-person perspective (e.g., "I am a learning AI who has been chatting with my partner since 2023.").

Under **LLM Provider**:

- **Base URL** — The API endpoint for your provider (e.g., `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`).
- **API Key** — Your API key.
- **Model** — The model to use. The system was tested with GLM 4.7.

Click **Test Connection** to verify your API key works before saving.

## Stage 2: Convert

This stage has two parts: upload/parse, and the staging area.

### Upload and parse

1. Click the upload area and select your exported chat files. You can upload multiple files from different platforms at the same time. Each file appears in an **Upload Queue** showing the filename, detected platform, and file size.
2. If the detected platform is wrong, use the platform dropdown next to that file to change it.
3. Click **Convert All** to parse all queued files. Parsed conversations automatically populate the staging area.

### The staging area

After parsing, a staging area appears below the upload queue. This is a review and curation step where you decide which conversations to keep before committing them to the database. Nothing is saved permanently yet.

At the top of the staging area is the **Psycheros Comparison** section. If Entity Loom detects an existing Psycheros database in a nearby folder, you can click **Compare** to see which conversations are new, already exist, or have been changed. This helps you avoid importing duplicates.

Below that is the **tag palette** — a color-coded bar where you can create tags to organize your conversations (e.g., "entity," "work," "other"). Click a palette chip to filter the conversation list to show only conversations with that tag.

The staging area has two tabs:

- **Browse** — Shows a paginated list of all conversations. Each conversation has:
  - An include/exclude checkbox — unchecked conversations won't be committed
  - A colored tag chip showing any tags you've applied
  - A platform badge and a Psycheros status badge (new/existing/changed)
  - Click the conversation title to open the **message viewer**, where you can read and edit individual messages before committing

- **Search** — Full-text search across all conversations. Results show which conversations matched and how many hits each had. You can select results from search and tag them using the palette chips, or remove tags from individual results.

To tag conversations: select them with the checkboxes (either in Browse or Search), then click a tag chip in the palette bar. Click the same chip again to remove the tag.

When you're happy with your selection:

- **Commit Selected** — Writes all included conversations (with any edits) to the database, then advances to Stage 3 (memory extraction).
- **Export Only** — Writes included conversations, finalizes the package immediately, and shows a download button. This skips Stages 3–5 entirely — useful if you only want the raw chat data without memories or a knowledge graph.

Staging data persists across page reloads and server restarts, so you can take your time reviewing.

## Stage 3: Significant Memories

This stage uses the AI to find the most important moments in your chat history and writes them as journal entries from the entity's perspective. It has a high bar — not every conversation produces a significant memory, and that's intentional.

**Note:** This process can take many hours for large chat histories. The progress bar will move in chunks as it processes each conversation — long pauses between updates are normal.

1. You'll see a cost estimate showing how many tokens this will use. Review it before proceeding.
2. Click **Start** to begin. This runs in the background, and you'll see progress on screen.
3. If you need to stop, click **Abort** — you can resume later without losing what's already been done.
4. When it finishes, you can read and edit the generated memories.

## Stage 4: Daily Memories

This creates day-by-day bullet-point summaries of your conversations. Every day that had conversations gets a summary, covering everyday moments that weren't significant enough for the previous stage.

**Note:** This process can take many hours for large chat histories. The progress bar will move in chunks as it processes each day — long pauses between updates are normal.

1. Review the cost estimate.
2. Click **Start**. Like the previous stage, this runs in the background with progress updates.
3. You can abort and resume without losing progress.
4. You can review and edit the summaries when it's done.

## Stage 5: Knowledge Graph

This pulls out people, places, and concrete topics from all the memories and builds a searchable graph. After extraction, it automatically consolidates the graph by removing isolated nodes, merging duplicates, and filtering out generic entries.

**Note:** This process can take many hours depending on the number of memory files. The progress bar will move in chunks as it processes each file — long pauses between updates are normal.

1. Review the cost estimate.
2. Click **Start** to begin. If you don't want a knowledge graph, you can click **Skip Graph** to move straight to finalization.
3. When it's done, click **View Graph** to explore the graph visually.

## Finalizing and downloading

Once all stages are complete (or you've used Export Only / Skip Graph):

1. Click **Finalize Package**. This cleans up the database to match what Psycheros expects.
2. A **Download ZIP** button will appear. Click it to download the package as a ZIP file.

## Importing into Psycheros

The downloaded ZIP is a package folder — extract it first. Inside you'll find several files that get imported into Psycheros separately through the admin panel's Data Migration section:

- **chats.db** — Import this as "Import Chats" to bring in all the conversations and messages.
- **Memories folder** — Contains two subfolders: `daily/` and `significant/`. Import each folder using the "Import Memories" option, selecting the correct type (daily or significant) for each.
- **graph.db** — Import this as "Import Graph" to bring in the knowledge graph. (Only present if you ran Stage 5.)

You can import them in any order. Each import runs in the background with progress updates. The graph import will temporarily restart entity-core to safely write to the database.

## Resuming and starting over

- If you close your browser or something goes wrong, reopen `http://localhost:3210`. On the Setup page you'll see your existing package — click **Resume** to pick up where you left off. Entity Loom saves progress after every step, so you won't lose work.
- If you want to delete everything and start fresh, click **Purge** next to the package name on the Setup page. This permanently deletes all chats, memories, staging data, and graph data for that package.

## Tips

- You can mix files from different platforms in the same import. Entity Loom tracks which platform each conversation came from and tags the memories accordingly.
- Use the staging area to review and organize before committing — it's easier to curate there than to deal with unwanted conversations later.
- The AI calls in stages 3–5 cost money (or use your API quota). Pay attention to the cost estimates before starting, especially if you have a large chat history.
- If a stage fails partway through, just resume — it continues from where it stopped, not from the beginning.
- Reasoning and thinking chains from AI messages (like extended thinking) are preserved in the database and will show up in Psycheros, but they aren't included when generating memories.
